# Useful Documentation

We are building this project because we want to learn web development.
This project is our first real website project, and we hope that it will
allow us to have a better grasp on the field of web development.

As such, we are constantly learning. Below is a list of some useful websites
and documentation we came accross while building TurboMail.

## Websites

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/) : Lots of well written documentation on various web development topics and technologies
[W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) : Useful website for various techonologies with examples and a live console.
[GeekForGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) : Often times the quick answer to any given simple computer science question

## Pages

[Ajax](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX) : Great documentation for the AJAX approach
